## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r install}
# Must install the devtools package using the below commented out code
install.packages("devtools")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r devtools}
# Then can install using the devtools package from either of the following:
devtools::install_github(repo = "maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR")
```

```{r}
# First load the package:
library(nflscrapR)
```

```{r}
# First load the package:
library(nflscrapR)

week_2_games <- scrape_game_ids(2018, weeks = 2)
# Display using the pander package:
install.packages("pander")
week_2_games %>%
  pander::pander()
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
week_5_games <- scrape_game_ids(2019, weeks = 5)
View(week_5_games)
week_5_games %>% pander::pander()
min_vs_nyg_pbp <- week_5_games %>% filter(home_team == "NYG") %>% pull(game_id) %>% scrape_json_play_by_play()
```

```{r}
# Install the awesome teamcolors package by Ben Baumer and Gregory Matthews:
install.packages("teamcolors")
```

```{r}
library(teamcolors)
# Pull out the Giants and Vikings colors:
nfl_teamcolors <- teamcolors %>% filter(league == "nfl")
nyg_color <- nfl_teamcolors %>%
  filter(name == "New York Giants") %>%
  pull(primary)
min_color <- nfl_teamcolors %>%
  filter(name == "Minnesota Vikings") %>%
  pull(primary)
```

```{r}
# Now generate the win probability chart:
min_vs_nyg_pbp %>%
  filter(!is.na(home_wp),
         !is.na(away_wp)) %>%
  dplyr::select(game_seconds_remaining,
                home_wp,
                away_wp) %>%
  gather(team, wpa, -game_seconds_remaining) %>%
